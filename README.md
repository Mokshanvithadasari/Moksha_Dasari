### A Dive into new depths!
A wise man once said "The measure of intelligence is the ability to change” because change is good, constant and now a days, inevitable. Hand picking a technology to learn depends on change in trend, need and interest.
Below are the technologies which I wish to and am currently making an effort to learn:
* ##### GIT - which is why I'm writing this readme :grin:
Version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging. Version control keep these revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. 
Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.

I found https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ helpful.
* ##### Natural Language Processing:
Natural Language Processing(NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence in which computers extract, analyze and understand the meaning of the human langugae and try to make a smart use of it. Developers can unlock the unstructured data to organize and structure knowledge which can help the interested users to use the information for decision making and analytics. By utilizing NLP, we can perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.

* ##### AZURE:
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers. They provide a wide spectrum of services which comes under the domains like Storage, compute, networking, security, monitoring, developer tools etcetra.

* ##### REST:
RESTful APIs -'RE'presentational 'S'tate 'T'ransfer, a huge buzzword all around. In REST Architecture, everything is considered as a resource and a resource is accessed by a common interface using HTTP standard methods. Out of the HTTP Methods, 4 are used commonly: 
 
   * GET - to fetch a resource
   * POST - to add a resource 
   * DELETE - to delete a resource
   * PUT - to update an exisiting resource

#### HOW TO RUN THE NATIVE CPP CODES
##### REQUIREMENTS
* Install a g++ compiler using MinGW-x64, an environment to support gcc, g++ and many other compilers(for Windows 10)
##### COMMANDS
The first line of the following code is a compiler invocation command used to generate an executable file with the name(*"preferred_name"* in this case) provided in the command before the name of the file(file_name.cpp in this case).

```
    g++ -o preferred_name file_name.cpp
    preferred_name
    arguments if any
```
